# Question: Fine-Tuning DINOv2 on Provident Dataset  
**Related to Issue #47 and #60**  

Dear Maintainers,  

I would like to clarify whether the DINOv2 model used in this project was:  
1. Fine-tuned specifically on the **Provident dataset**?  

Understanding this distinction will help determine the next steps for implementation and replication.  

Thank you for your assistance!
